# Day 4 - Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Overview

This was Day 4 of an AI Accelerator program focused on transforming AI from a simple chatbot into a digital team through Model Context Protocol (MCP). The session was led by Dilip, an AI researcher with seven years of experience at IIT Madras and published papers in international AI conferences.

## Learning Objectives

The session aimed to help participants:

- Understand MCP in plain English without technical jargon
- Learn two levels of MCP implementation (easy and advanced modes)
- Watch AI connect to various tools and applications
- Explore practical use cases for MCP
- Build excitement about MCP possibilities

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

### The Food Court Analogy

Dilip explained MCP using a relatable food court metaphor:

**Traditional Approach**: When you visit a food court, you personally walk to each stall (Chinese, Pizza, Indian, Soda) to order food and bring it back to your table. This represents the normal way we interact with different applications - switching context between each tool.

**MCP Approach**: Imagine having a personal waiter who takes your complete order, visits all the different stalls on your behalf, collects everything, and brings it all to your table in one go. The waiter is MCP, you are the AI user, and the various food stalls represent different applications and tools.

### Technical Definition

MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol**, broken down as:

- **Model**: The LLM (Large Language Model) like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini
- **Context**: The background, objective, and purpose of what you're trying to achieve
- **Protocol**: The established rules of communication between the LLM and various tools

### MCP vs API vs Webhooks

The instructor used helpful analogies to distinguish these concepts:

**API (Application Programming Interface)**:

- Like having different keys for different hotel rooms
- Each application requires its own specific connection
- Similar to different plug points in different countries (US plugs vs Indian plugs vs European plugs)

**Webhooks**:

- Like an alarm bell or doorbell
- Instead of repeatedly checking if something is ready (API), webhooks notify you when an event occurs
- Event-driven rather than polling-based

**MCP**:

- Like a universal plug adapter that works in any country
- One interface that can connect to multiple applications
- Eliminates the need for context switching between different tools

## Implementation Levels

      }
    }
    
    ```
    

## Practical Demonstrations

### Demo 1: File System MCP - Desktop Organization

**Use Case**: Organizing a cluttered desktop automatically

**Process**:

1. Connected file system MCP server with desktop and documents folder permissions
2. Prompted Claude: "Look at my desktop and it is absolutely cluttered. Can you rearrange the desktop with appropriate folders and reorganize my desktop for me?"
3. Claude analyzed the desktop contents and created organized directory structure
4. Automatically moved files into appropriate folders (Documents, Work, Business, Media, Images, etc.)

**Key Learning**: MCP can act as a mini executive assistant, creating intelligent file organization systems without manual intervention.

### Demo 2: Combining Local Data with Web Research

**MCP Servers Used**:

- File System MCP (local data access)
- Perplexity MCP (web research)

**Use Case**: Data science salary analysis

**Process**:

1. Prompt: "I have a dssalaries.csv file on my desktop. Can you read the file and compare the data science salaries in the US today using Perplexity?"
2. Claude used File System MCP to read the local CSV file
3. Claude used Perplexity MCP to research current 2025 salary data
4. Automatically compared local historical data with current market trends

**Results**:

- Entry-level data scientists: Historical data showed $25k-$30k, current market shows $90k-$125k
- Senior data scientists: Historical data $120k-$175k aligns with current $165k-$120k range
- ML engineers showed decreased salary trends compared to historical data

### Demo 3: Web Scraping with Apify MCP

**Key Concepts**:

- Each scraper in Apify is called an "Actor"
- Available actors include: Website Scraper, Instagram Scraper, YouTube Scraper, TikTok Scraper
- MCP functions: Find Actor, Search Actor

**Use Case**: YouTube video analysis for content creation

**Process**:

1. Prompt: "Use Apify MCP to analyze this Andrej Karpathy video and come up with viral topics"
2. Claude searched for appropriate YouTube transcript scraper actor
3. Extracted complete transcript from the video
4. Analyzed content for successful elements
5. Generated viral topic suggestions and sample posts

**Setup Requirements**:

- Apify account and API token from console.apify.com
- Configuration entry in MCP config file

### Demo 4: Advanced Content Creation Pipeline

## Technical Requirements and Considerations

### System Requirements

**Hard Mode Setup**:

- Desktop or laptop only (no mobile/tablet support currently)
- Claude Desktop application
- Node.js runtime environment
- Local configuration file management

**API Keys and Accounts**:

- Perplexity API key (for web research)
- Apify API token (for web scraping)
- Various service-specific credentials as needed

### Privacy and Security Considerations

**File Access Permissions**:

- MCP servers only access explicitly permitted directories
- User must grant permission for each file system operation
- Recommended to start with limited permissions and expand as needed

**Data Privacy**:

- Local MCP servers process data on local machine
- API-based MCPs send data to respective services
- Users should review privacy policies of integrated services

### Current Limitations

**Technology Maturity**:

- MCP is very new technology (nascent stage)

- Some integrations limited to paid plans

## Key Takeaways and Future Implications

### Productivity Revolution

MCP represents a fundamental shift from context switching between multiple applications to having AI orchestrate tool interactions automatically. Instead of manually copying data between Gmail, Calendar, CRM, Slack, and other tools, users can work from a single AI interface.

### Competitive Advantage

The session emphasized that participants learning MCP are entering the top 1% of AI users, as 99.9% of people don't yet understand this technology. This early adoption provides significant competitive advantages in AI-native problem solving.

### Integration with Upcoming Sessions
