# Day 2 - **Voice AI Agent Development Training Using VAPI**

### **1. Objective and Context**

This training session focused on building and deploying voice-based AI agents using **VAPI**, a no-code platform designed for developing intelligent voice applications. The primary goal was to demonstrate how to create AI voice agents that can autonomously manage phone-based interactions for tasks such as appointment booking, lead qualification, customer service, and HR screening. The session also showcased integrations with automation tools like **Make.com** and **n8n**, enabling end-to-end workflow automation.

# Demonstrations

### **1. VAPI Platform Features – Core Capabilities Discussed**

The session covered VAPI’s key functionalities for building AI voice agents without writing code, with an emphasis on production-ready voice experiences.

### **A. Dialog Flow Builder (Visual Interface)**

- Drag-and-drop environment to create conversational logic.
- Allows for:
    - Conditional branching (e.g., different paths based on user intent).
    - Memory storage and recall (e.g., saving user-provided data like names or dates).
    - Re-prompts and fallback logic (handling no-input or misunderstood responses).
    - Global flows (e.g., “cancel” or “speak to a human” intents accessible from anywhere).

### **B. Intent and Entity Management**

- **Intent Recognition**: Assigns user statements to predefined intents (e.g., "book appointment", "ask pricing").
- **Entity Extraction**: Automatically pulls structured values like dates, phone numbers, and service types from conversations.

### **C. Call Control Features**

- Control over call pacing, interruption handling, pauses, and speech variation for more natural delivery.
- **Live transcription** and real-time interaction tracking during calls.
- Customizable **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** voices and **Speech-to-Text (STT)** engines.

### **D. Memory and Context Handling**

- The AI agent can store and recall information throughout the call (e.g., “You said you want a massage on Friday at 3 PM — is that correct?”).
- Variables can be used across different steps to personalize and validate information.

### **E. Multilingual and Regional Voice Support**

- Ability to deploy agents in different languages with localized voice settings.
- Select from multiple voice providers (e.g., Google, ElevenLabs, Amazon Polly) depending on tone and accent preferences.

### **F. Integrations and External Workflows**

- **n8n and Make.com Integration**:
    - Trigger flows after specific intents (e.g., send email after a booking).
    - Push user data to Google Sheets, Notion, Slack, or CRMs.
    - Trigger follow-up SMS using Twilio or WhatsApp.
- **Webhooks and APIs**:
    - Configure webhooks for real-time data push to external systems.
    - Use VAPI’s REST API for initiating outbound calls programmatically.

### **2. Demonstration: Inbound and Outbound AI Call Configuration**

The live demonstration walked through how to build and test both **inbound** and **outbound** AI-powered voice agents using the VAPI platform.

---

### **A. Inbound Call Agent Configuration**

**Objective**: Set up an AI agent to answer incoming calls, handle appointment requests, and route data externally.

**Steps Demonstrated:**

1. **Create a New Agent**:
    - Select *“Inbound Agent”* type from the dashboard.
    - Assign a virtual phone number (provided by VAPI or integrated via Twilio).
2. **Dialog Flow Design**:
    - Initial greeting and purpose (“Hi, thanks for calling Wellness Spa. How can I help you today?”).
    - User intent recognition for tasks like “book appointment” or “ask about services.”
    - Capturing and confirming appointment details (e.g., date, time, service).
    - Fallback logic for unexpected queries.
3. **Integration Trigger (e.g., n8n)**:
    - After booking confirmation, agent sends a webhook to an n8n workflow.
    - The workflow logs data in Google Sheets and sends a confirmation SMS to the customer.
4. **Testing**:
    - Simulated a live call using VAPI’s internal test interface.
    - Observed live transcription, variable capture, and automation trigger confirmation.

---

### **B. Outbound Call Agent Configuration**

**Objective**: Configure an AI agent to make outgoing calls to leads or customers for appointment reminders or lead qualification.

**Steps Demonstrated:**

1. **Create a New Agent**:
    - Choose *“Outbound Agent”* type.
    - Define the purpose and call script logic.
2. **Outbound Call Trigger Setup**:
    - Used the **API trigger** and an **n8n workflow** to initiate calls to a phone list.
    - Each contact in the list had an associated intent (e.g., reminder, offer follow-up).
3. **Dialog Flow Customization**:
    - Included dynamic content insertion (e.g., “Hi [Name], this is a reminder about your 3 PM appointment at Serenity Spa”).
    - Logic branches based on user response (e.g., confirm, reschedule, cancel).
    - Conditional follow-up: If user says “cancel,” trigger SMS with cancellation link.
4. **Testing**:
    - Outbound call initiated through n8n with a sample phone number.
    - Live call monitoring showed real-time transcription, variable substitution, and success/failure status.

### **3. Call Handling Features Shown in Action**

- **Interrupt Handling**: Agent can detect when users interrupt or speak over the bot, and adjust responses.
- **Re-prompting**: After silence or ambiguous input, the agent follows up with a clarifying question.
- **Escalation Triggers**: If the agent detects frustration or repeated failure, it can route the call to a human or log it for follow-up.

---

### **4. Key Takeaways from the Demonstration**

- **Rapid Build Capability**: Full-featured voice agents can be configured and deployed in under 30 minutes.
- **Natural Interaction**: TTS voices and memory handling produced human-like conversations.
- **Automation Ready**: VAPI’s design easily connects to workflows via n8n or Make.com, enabling complete backend automation without custom code.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Capable of handling multiple simultaneous calls and multilingual support for broader deployment.
